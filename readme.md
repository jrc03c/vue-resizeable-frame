# Intro

This template is now updated for Vue 3. Note that it uses Vite for building single-file components, so the [vue-component-css-mixin](https://github.com/jrc03c/vue-component-css-mixin) library is no longer needed. (Technically, it wasn't needed before, but I just didn't much care for the previous tooling.)
